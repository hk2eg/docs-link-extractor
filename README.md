GUI Link Extractor

Currently Supports:
- PDF (manual table selection)
- Excel (.xlsx) (Auto Link Extraction)
- CSV

How to Use:
1. Run the .exe
2. Drag a file or browse to open a file
3. For PDFs, draw red rectangles around links
4. Click Done to extract links into a text file
5. You customize your save location with the "Choose Save Location" option

Startup:
To run this at every Windows login (tray icon), double-click:

Future Improvements:

- Fixing a bug where choosing a save location is forcing the user to select a text file instead of a folder
